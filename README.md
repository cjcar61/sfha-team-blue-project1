# sfha-team-blue-project1
A very ugly website that checks all the boxes for project 1....I think
Our client is requesting the following as ‘must haves’:
When the hamburger menu is clicked, the menu must ‘toggle’ in and out
The main content, including the image must get no wider than 1000px
Below 1000px the main content must be 100% across the screen
Filler content (Any text will do)
